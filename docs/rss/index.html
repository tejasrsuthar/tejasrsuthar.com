As I don't want extra clutter to maintain a CMS site. I was always wanted a simple blogging system that is flexible enough that I don't have to spend too much time to maintain it. </p><p>Initially I was using a static site generator like Jekyll. It was really good site generator from markdown files. I worked on it for few months and developed a site as well from it and host it to github. After few time I was busy working on other freelancing projects and really didn't look at it. </p><p>After couple of years, when I look at the static site generator era, its completely different storm here. Everyone is talking about <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JamStack</a> and static site generator and there also <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost CMS</a> was available. It's the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system">headless CMS</a> I've ever worked with. Typing on its editor is just a breeze. </p><p>Continue.... </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I prepared for my AWS certification]]></title><description><![CDATA[Complete information about how to pass the AWS Certification and what needs to be taken care of in order to pass them in couple of months. ]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/how-i-prepared-for-my-aws-certification/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5d6b986cbef5750c38903f08</guid><category><![CDATA[AWS Certification]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tejas Suthar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 10:10:28 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1456406644174-8ddd4cd52a06?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1456406644174-8ddd4cd52a06?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="How I prepared for my AWS certification"><p>AWS Certification is one of the well known certification in Cloud App development. It's really very well worthy certification and I was planning for it for couple of years, but really didn't got the chance till date. Just few months back I was having some free days as my recent assignments with Mobiquity Inc. as a remote developer was completed and mostly was having full day time. </p><p>It was really difficult to setup the plan for AWS certification initially. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Test Post with Image]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Just testing the post with images.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/09/WhatsApp-Image-2018-07-23-at-10.01.29-PM.jpeg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>My Baby at birth time</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image-->]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/test-post-with-image/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5d6b8cb4bef5750c38903ee8</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tejas Suthar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 09:18:43 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just testing the post with images.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/09/WhatsApp-Image-2018-07-23-at-10.01.29-PM.jpeg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>My Baby at birth time</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image-->]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
