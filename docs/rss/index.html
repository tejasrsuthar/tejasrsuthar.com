I was always wanted a simple blogging system that is flexible enough that I don't have to spend too much time to maintain it. </p><p>Initially I was using a static site generator like <strong>Jekyll</strong>. It was really good site generator from markdown files. I worked on it for few months and developed a site as well from it and host it to github. After few time I was busy working on other freelancing projects and really didn't look at it. </p><p>After couple of years, when I look at the static site generator era, its completely different trend here. Everyone is talking about <a href="https://jamstack.org/"><strong>JamStack</strong></a> and static site generator and there also <a href="https://ghost.org/"><strong>Ghost CMS</strong></a> was available. It's the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system"><strong>headless CMS</strong></a> I've ever worked with. Typing on its editor is just a breeze. </p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now a days, there are so many options to host a static site and I find this way more clinical and suits my requirements. You can still host this static site in S3 bucket as a static site hosting. You need to pay minimal amount to host files there. And with that S3 bucket setup you also have the liberty to use the CloudFront CDN, that will improve caching ability and users get low latency. </p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I prepared for my AWS certification]]></title><description><![CDATA[Complete information about how to pass the AWS Certification and what needs to be taken care of in order to pass them in couple of months. ]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/how-i-prepared-for-my-aws-certification/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5d6b986cbef5750c38903f08</guid><category><![CDATA[AWS Certification]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tejas Suthar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 10:10:28 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1456406644174-8ddd4cd52a06?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1456406644174-8ddd4cd52a06?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="How I prepared for my AWS certification"><p>AWS Certification is one of the well known certification in Cloud App development.
