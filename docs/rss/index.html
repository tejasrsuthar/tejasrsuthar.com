And the best signs of a great instructors is that they make learning complex problems so easier that it can be digest very easily for a novice/beginner user as well. Stephene has the skills and ability to do that consistently. And I would highly recommend his course before any second thoughts. </p><h3 id="aws-white-papers-optional-">AWS White papers (optional)</h3><p>I did not explore white papers for my preparation.

It gives very very good overview of the each service offering and how to use them. I rad them multiple times for each AWS services. And it really helped me a lot. Most of the questions I got was from FAQs sections. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/faqs/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">AWS Lambda – FAQs</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Read our AWS Lambda Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://a0.awsstatic.com/libra-css/images/site/touch-icon-ipad-144-smile.png" alt="How to prepare for AWS Certification"><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Amazon Web Services, Inc.</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://a0.awsstatic.com/libra-css/images/logos/aws_logo_smile_1200x630.png" alt="How to prepare for AWS Certification"></div></a></figure><hr><h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2><p>My simple strategy was to just explore the Stephene Maarek's course and and keep notes. I prepared a notes for each AWS Services. The critical part of the certification is that there are so many services you need to learn and its really difficult to keep track of each after hands-on experience. </p><p>So its always better to keep a single line notes for each service. I got to create a notebook with stripes for each services marked. And later on when I was preparing on my final days, I just went through each AWS service notes within almost an hour. </p><hr><h2 id="test-your-skills">Test your skills</h2><p>Before giving final exam, I would recommend to give practice test exams. This would give you a lot more confidence and you'll do better in your final exams.</p><p>For testing exams, I took another course by Stephene Maarek. There were 4 practice tests in a course I took. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-tests-dva-c01"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">AWS Certified Developer Associate [4 Practice Exam Tests]</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ v2020: The practice exams were created in 2019 and will be kept up-to-date all of 2020.

It took really about an hour to get most of the information for AWS Services. </p><p>The exam needs to be given at AWS recognized centers. And I would recommend to reach exam center before an hour just to make sure you get enough time incase if uneven things happens. </p><hr><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>AWS Certification exam results are instant. Means you'll get the information about whether you've passed the exam or not. </p><p>After a week, you'll be having the result marks in your registered emails. </p><hr><h2 id="show-off">Show off</h2><p>And after passing the exam, it give you really great feeling to achieve something, because believe me, this exam is not easy to clear. You've to have enough concentration to answer the questions. And the funny things is that initially all the answers looks same to you. And you'll only notice the difference when you read them multiple times. </p><p>Yes, you'll get your badge from AWS Certification account and you can have their certification logo. Also you can add them to your email signature. It looks great. </p><p> At the time of writing, the AWS Certification verification site is moved to <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/">YourAcclaim Service</a></p><p>Here is my certification <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/earner/earned/badge/624194fb-f3c4-47e4-8e3e-40369c91a638">badge url</a> for example.</p><hr><h2 id="get-better-carrier-opportunities">Get better carrier opportunities</h2><p>After getting the AWS Certification, I believe you'll be having more exposure to potential clients. As clients are specifically looking for the developers who have proved themselves by giving exams as compare to the developers without the certification.</p><p>Obviously you should not brag yourself with your certifications but you can certainly consider an edge over your competitor developers in interview and you can have added advantage. </p><hr><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>AWS certification is really good recognization and it can open a lot of opportunities to work with potential clients. It really improves the overall AWS services knowledge. </p><p>Let me know your thoughts. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best way to setup JamStack with Ghost and github pages. ✍️ 👍]]></title><description><![CDATA[Post explains my experiences while setting up JamStack blog powered by  Ghost HeadLess CMS and GitHub Pages - Awesomeness. ✍️]]></description><link>https://tejasrsuthar.com/best-way-to-setup-jamstack-with-ghost-and-github-pages/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f17ccd434ecc42c7576041d</guid><category><![CDATA[jamstack]]></category><category><![CDATA[GitHub Pages]]></category><category><![CDATA[headless cms]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tejas Suthar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 10:29:45 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498050108023-c5249f4df085?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498050108023-c5249f4df085?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Best way to setup JamStack with Ghost and github pages. ✍️ 👍"><p>I was really in a need of tech stack where I can write technical blog but it was really time consuming to run a Wordpress blog fore multiple reasons like a it was really heavy for normal tech blogger like me - <strong>JamStack with Ghost and github pages</strong>.  As I don't want extra clutter to maintain a CMS site. I was always wanted a simple blogging system that is flexible enough that I don't have to spend too much time to maintain it. </p><p>Initially I was using a static site generator like <strong>Jekyll</strong>. It was really good site generator from markdown files. I worked on it for few months and developed a site as well from it and host it to github. After few time I was busy working on other freelancing projects and really didn't look at it. </p><p>After couple of years, when I look at the static site generator era, its completely different trend here. Everyone is talking about <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JamStack</a> and static site generator and there also <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost CMS</a> was available. It's the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system">headless CMS</a> I've ever worked with. Typing on its editor is just a breeze. </p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
