<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Main AWS Certification Site Link: </p><p>======================== <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate" rel="noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate</a>/ Course you can take:</p><p> =================== </p><p>Udemy course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01" rel="noopener">https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01</a>/ (Price: 360 Rs. - You can take it now, promotions are running ) </p><p>The author <strong>Stephene Mareek</strong> is a very good instructor and I took this course. It helped me a lot. Also apart from this course, I took another practice test course from the same author. I would advise to take them as well. This will give you more confidence. </p><p>Practice tests course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-tests-dva-c01" rel="noopener">https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-tests-dva-c01</a>/ </p><p>There are also whitepapers from AWS you can review, but I didn't and it's fine if you just have a single look into it. </p><p>You can approach this: </p><p>Take an overview of all the links info given in the main certification site. (Just to make sure if anything new comes up in certification or any news. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate" rel="noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate</a>/) </p><p>Start the purchased course and the author will help you with everything from testing on AWS console to how to give the exams and which are the exam important questions. </p><p>Take the pen and paper and write down important key questions/ answers from the course. After your course gets completed you can start the other practice exam course where 4 question papers are available in the form of a quiz. Try to give them one by and make sure you secure more than 80 marks. </p><p>I believe passing marks are 70 but if you secure 80 marks in those tests than you'll pretty much get good experience and confidence. If you do not secure 80 marks, then just try to see where you're failing and practice those areas more. </p><p>Once you're confident enough, just create an account in the AWS certification site and book a slot for the exam. We've in Ahmedabad the center is in Naroda. </p><p>You can book a slot there. Make sure to book a slot once you're almost ready for the exam. And do not book very late otherwise you may forget what you've learned in the past. Best of luck and let me know if you've any other questions.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best way to setup JamStack with Ghost and github pages. ✍️ 👍]]></title><description><![CDATA[Post explains my experiences while setting up JamStack blog powered by  Ghost HeadLess CMS and GitHub Pages - Awesomeness. ✍️]]></description><link>tejasrsuthar.com/best-way-to-setup-jamstack-with-ghost-and-github-pages/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f17ccd434ecc42c7576041d</guid><category><![CDATA[jamstack]]></category><category><![CDATA[GitHub Pages]]></category><category><![CDATA[headless cms]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tejas Suthar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 10:29:45 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498050108023-c5249f4df085?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498050108023-c5249f4df085?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Best way to setup JamStack with Ghost and github pages. ✍️ 👍"><p>I was really in a need of tech stack where I can write technical blog but it was really time consuming to run a Wordpress blog fore multiple reasons like a it was really heavy for normal tech blogger like me - <strong>JamStack with Ghost and github pages</strong>.  As I don't want extra clutter to maintain a CMS site. I was always wanted a simple blogging system that is flexible enough that I don't have to spend too much time to maintain it. </p><p>Initially I was using a static site generator like <strong>Jekyll</strong>. It was really good site generator from markdown files. I worked on it for few months and developed a site as well from it and host it to github. After few time I was busy working on other freelancing projects and really didn't look at it. </p><p>After couple of years, when I look at the static site generator era, its completely different trend here. Everyone is talking about <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JamStack</a> and static site generator and there also <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost CMS</a> was available. It's the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system">headless CMS</a> I've ever worked with. Typing on its editor is just a breeze. </p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Each of the above requirements will be resolved by the JamStack hosted to Github Pages. </p><p>What I did was, </p><ul><li>just apply for the custom domain from <strong>Godaddy</strong>. </li><li>setup Ghost CMS on local for article writing</li><li>use <strong>wget </strong>to generate the static site in <strong>/docs</strong> folder</li><li>setup Github Repository and push the code to it</li><li>setup Github pages published from <strong>/docs</strong> folder &amp; received domain <a href="https://tejasrsuthar.github.io/blog/">https://tejasrsuthar.github.io/blog/</a></li><li>add CNAME file to <strong>/docs </strong>folder and provided the custom domain (<strong>note:</strong> I've not yet setup my custom domain.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now a days, there are so many options to host a static site and I find this way more clinical and suits my requirements. You can still host this static site in S3 bucket as a static site hosting. You need to pay minimal amount to host files there. And with that S3 bucket setup you also have the liberty to use the CloudFront CDN, that will improve caching ability and users get low latency. </p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
